In November 2015 BCII Connect held their first ever Ball, a night of 60â€™s themed fun where members from both year groups were given the opportunity to dance the night away. For many, it was also a nice way to introduce partners and friends to the concept of BCII, and the people who make it up. Held at the UTS Aerial Function Centre, the event was a huge success, selling out in a matter of days. Complete with a DJ, photographer, delicious canapes and an open bar, the night was destined to be a success before it began. Anything involving BCII could never be ordinary, and as such the event incorporated a series of dramatic murder mystery performances with guests able to guess as to who may be the murderer. Twists like this are the signature trademark of a BCII Society Event.
