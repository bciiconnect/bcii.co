                <p>BCII Connect is Faculty society for for those who double with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation. We draw students from across the university to solidify our BCII networks by engaging with fresh ideas, curious people and cool events. Our cohort is made up of crazy, unique, innovative and likeminded individuals stemming from almost every core degree that UTS has to offer. A group of such diversity means that students are hard pressed to find times to get together, discuss ideas and just hang out during the semester, BCII Connect Society organises a multiplex of social events and mixers for all students between year groups to get together.<br><br>But organising great parties is not all we do. Our members are passionate about innovation, creativity and social change, and so it is important that we help provide them with access to knowledge and resources. The society regularly holds campfires, where guest speakers and peers are given opportunities to present concepts, products or environments to attendants, and where attendants are given the space to ask questions or propose alternative methods and ways of thinking.<br><br>We also like to provide our members with the tools to innovate in the workplace, and as such organise many hack-a-thons, international conferences, government think tanks and innovative cultural activities, where our members are able to pick and choose what interests them, and engage with industry professionals who are passionate as we are about the role of innovative creativity in workplaces of the future.<br><br>Unlike typical American university societies we value the uniqueness and diversity of our cohort. Unlike many large societies in Australian universities, we actually know each and every one of our members. We are small and new, but by no means shy. People say ‘why fix what’s not broken’. We say, why not break it apart and see how we can make it better.</p>
